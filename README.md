# Parse .txt to .csv

This is a simple node program that takes in a .txt file and parse it and output an .csv file format.

Note that this program is tailored specificly for a text format. the sample can be found in the repo as well.

To run it
```
node parse-text-to-csv.js [input-file.txt] [output-file.csv]
```

The input and output names are optional, they will be default to the names as listed in the repo. I included that just for your convenience if your test file names are different.
